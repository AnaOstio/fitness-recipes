We have used an existing [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pes12017000148/food-ingredients-and-recipe-dataset-with-images) in order to have information from different existing recipes, but these recipes did not have all the necessary information. For this, we have used Python with Numpy + Pandas to generate this information.

In the case that some information doesn't look realistic, it's normal. The missing data was generated randomly.

## How to use it?

- First of all move to the scripts folder, if you are in the root of the project.

```
cd scripts/
```

- Then run script.py
In case you want to use the generated csv (foodFilled2.csv), you need to remove the first row, which represents the csv header.
